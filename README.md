Control Structures Overview:
=============================
•	Control structures determine the flow of execution in a program.

•	Types of control structures: Sequential, Conditional, Repetition.

1. Sequential Structure:
   
   •	Executes code in the order it is written.


3. Conditional Structure:
   
   •	Executes code based on conditions (decision-making).

   •	Common conditional statements:

    o	if statement
    o	if-else statement
    o	Nested if statement
    o	if-elif-else statement

    
5. Repetition Structure:
   
   •	Executes code repeatedly (looping).

   •	Two types of loops:

   o	for loop: Iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string).
   
   o	while loop: Repeats as long as a condition is true.



Python Functions Overview:
==========================
•	Functions are blocks of code that run when called.

•	Functions can accept parameters and return data.

•	Promote code organization, reusability, and readability.


1. Basic Function:
   
  •	Define a function using def.

  •	Call the function by its name.

2. Default Parameters:
   
  •	Assign default values to function parameters.

3. Variable Scope:

  •	Variables inside a function are local to that function.

4. Docstrings:

  • Document functions using triple quotes to describe their purpose and usage.

5. Arbitrary Arguments (*args):
   
  •	Accept a variable number of positional arguments.

6. Keyword Arguments:
   
  •	Pass values using parameter names.

7. Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (**kwargs):
   
  •	Accept a variable number of keyword arguments.

8. Recursion:
    
  •	A function calling itself to solve smaller subproblems.

9. Function Annotations:
    
  •	Specify types for function arguments and return values.

10. Closures:
    
  •	Functions capturing and remembering the environment where they were created.

11. First-Class Functions:
    
  •	Functions are treated as first-class objects (can be passed as arguments and returned from other functions).

Python Modules Overview:
=========================
•	Modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables).

•	They allow code organization and reusability.

•	Import modules in other scripts to use their functionality.
